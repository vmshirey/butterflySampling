# butterflySampling
 
This repository contains the scripts used in determining how completely sampled a given grid is for butterfly richness by using range maps as a baseline estimate of expected richness. The manuscript associated with this code is currently under review and this README will be update to reflect the current status of this project as the peer-review proecess proceeds.
